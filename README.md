# Vert.x Http Proxy

[简体中文](README.zh-cn.md)

A HTTP reverse proxy based on Vert.x, it aims to implement the reverse proxy logic and be reusable, so one does not need to care about the proxy logic and can focus rather on higher concerns.

It is really in early status. I think Vert.x didnot have proxy example is reasonable. It is really simple using basic component.

But... of course it is not the final destination of this project. More on the way...

## Redis Session Store

An implementation of Vert.x session store using redis was included in this project.
